It takes the last value assigned to it if assigned more than one time.

x = 4 #x is of type int
x = "abc" #x is of type string

To print,
print("")

To print a text and a variable already assigned use +
print("abc"+x)
This will print abcabc
'+' can also be used to combine two strings.

3 number types in python,
  Integer
  Float
  Complex

To verify the type use the function type()
print(type(x))

If required to specify the type,can be type casted using hte constructor function.
w = str(3.0)
x = int(3)
y = int(4.5)
z = float(1)
When w is printed it is considered as string 3.0
When y is printed,it print 4 and not 4.5.
When z is printed,it prints 1.0

PYHTON STRINGS

Let a = 'awesome'
print(a[1]) outputs w
print(a[3:8]) outputs some

Strip Method
This deletes any white spaces at the beginning and at the end of the string
Let b = ' amazing ',
print(b.strip()) returns 'amazing'

len() function
print(len(b)) outputs the length of the string assigned to b.Since here it is amazing it outputs 9 since white  spaces are also considered.
