Understanding Github

Github is  a website in which we could publish repositories to collaborate worldwide.

There are basic commands to be followed for this.First of all we should install git which is a Version Control System(VCS).

To install git,

sudo apt-get install git

After installing git we can push or pull repositories with the help of some commands in the terminal.

To push a repository,

1)create a repository in your account.

2)clone the repository to your local system.


	git clone url(can be found on the address bar or on the next github page that you get after creating the repository)


3)make sure that the file to be pushed is in your repository or you may copy it using the command

	cp filename repository/

4)use  git add filename to update all the changes that you made in your file.

5)to add a comment about what the content is actually about use 


	git commit -u ""


6)now push it to the required branch


	git push origin master


Master is the default branch.
