Protocols are rules.So communication protocols are the rules for communication.
They have a clear cut approach that either to follow the rules or not to communicate.
They usually include UART,USART,SPI,I2C.
UART:Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter
USART:Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter
SPI:Serial Peripheral Interface
I2C:Inter Integrated Circuit

UART
UART is the hardware that deals with serial communication through serial ports.
It is a standalone IC also found along with microcontrollers.
Since it is a serial communication hardware,it transfers one bit at a time sequentially through the channel.
Shift Registers are one unavoidable part of these devices as they are the one responsible for the conversion of serial data to parallel data.
UART as the name suggests deals with asynchronous data hence is provided internally with a clock.So they works in the Baude rate,where baude rate is the no. of symbols per second.
